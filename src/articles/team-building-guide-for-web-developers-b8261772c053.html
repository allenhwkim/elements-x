<h1 class="title"><b>Team Building Guide For Web Developers</b></h1>
<p>“She does not respond my message!”</p>
<p>“He works so slowly!!!”</p>
<p>“Why does it take so long?”</p>
<p>“He is total a** h***!!”</p>
<p>We hear these complaints everyday, and it’s easy to think like the above;</p>
<h1><b>Blame the System Not the People</b></h1>
<p>However, it’s not easy to find the reason why he or she say these people-blaming, hurting, and attacking-comments. Please remember that you are working on a system every day that your company has built and people are following the system.</p>
<p>You can always find very systematic reason on every team-hurting comments. Let’s try to find reasons behind the above comments.</p>
<p><b>“He works so slowly!!!”</b>There is a work flow system that does not force him to finish on-time</p>
<p><b>“She doe not respond my email!”</b>There might be a better way than asynchronous email. i.e. messenger, or sitting together?</p>
<p><b>“Why does it take so long?”</b>Priority is not set in your company?</p>
<p><b>“He is total a** hole!!”</b>Something wrong with hiring process and reviewing system?</p>
<p>It is because of the system built by management, and not because of the people who follows the system or taking advantage of it. You can change the system by telling your manager and team lead to improve it. You don’t have to offend people or especially hurt you by blaming other people.</p>
<p>You already know that you can’t change people, but you can change the system.</p>
<p>Let us stop pointing a finger to people because they will not see your idea but only your finger.</p>
<h1><b>Respect The Existing Code</b></h1>
<p>You don’t like the existing code. No, you don’t. Now, you want to rewrite it because you may say “the code sucks”, “we are so much smarter now”, or “we picked the wrong platform or language”.</p>
<p>The code that you don’t like is <i>the code your current or previous team have spent lots of time and money to build</i>, and there has been always more than one developer assigned to write code, review, and test, and finally they have made it work.</p>
<p>The reality is that, total rewriting is never a good idea because it ALWAYS takes longer time than you expect, and the delay of delivery caused by rewriting may not satisfy your business requirements. Most of all, you don’t control the rewrite, it controls you.</p>
<p>Also, there is always some guide line in your team to follow about how to code, e.g. , style guide. The coding guide, that you currently have, might not be good enough for you, but you have a chance to improve it. Try to avoid to put your own coding style or design pattern into the existing application, because it always makes other team members not happy. Put your team first. If you want to be creative, you had better do it at home.</p>
<h1><b>Bring Outside-Code With Discussion</b></h1>
<p>Don’t you think your team members already have enough things to learn; SOAP, REST, ETag, SASS, FOUC, ARIA, HTML5, SVG, AMD, AJAX, Angular, Angular2 and JSONP?</p>
<p>You want to add one more for your team members to learn because you like it? Although your intention is good, but it may result in bad response from your team.</p>
<p>Bring outside-code is like you let strangers come into your office. Unless it is a standard or industry-wide accepted practices, it’s better to put outside-code to the existing application with discussion. You can start discussion by simply sending out email listing “why we need it” and “how we use it”.</p>
<h1><b>Don’t Forget To Say “Thank You”</b></h1>
<p>In work place, there is no reason not to express gratitude when you talk to other. No matter how topic discussion goes bad, at least, they are spending their time for chatting with you, meeting with you, typing email to you, reviewing your code, or any. Unless they express their unhappiness to you, even with that case, please say “Thank you for your time”.</p>
<p>Saying “Thank You” not only makes people bond together, but also suppress your negative feelings toward others because you will say “Thank You” at the end of conversation anyway.</p>
<h1><b>The Code is Not Yours, But Next Developers’</b></h1>
<p>Can you say you are the owner of the code? No, right?</p>
<p>Did you pay someone to have that ownership? No, you got paid for your coding. It’s simply true that your code does not belong to you. It belongs to the company, and the company always want the code easily maintainable and understandable for the next developers when you are not there.</p>
