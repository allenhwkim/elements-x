<h1 class="title">You Clean Up House. How About Code?</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">You should review the existing code implementation. We call it as refactoring.</h2>
<h2>What is refactoring?</h2>
<p><b>Refactoring is house-keeping work in your professional development</b>.</p>
<p>Here is the diagram how you start development and how you improve it again again, which is called as SDLC; Software Development Life Cyele.</p>
<li class="bulletin">Planning > Analysis > Design > Coding > Test > Debug > Deploy</li>

<p>Your initial development is <b>always</b> as good as planned.</p>
<p>Then, you add more planning, more design, more implementation on the top of original planning, design, and implementation.</p>
<p>After tens of more implementations later, your system will look like this.</p>

<p>Implementation affects design, and design troubles analysis. Sometimes, we skip analysis and design for MVP projects. We just plan and implement it.</p>
<p><b>Comparing to server room crisis, we started like this, clean implementation.</b></p>

<p><b>Then it will become like this after number of additional implementation.</b></p>
<p>Did you see the sign? <span class="quote">DO NOT TOUCH ANY OF THESE WIRES!!!</span></p>

<h2>Q: So, what went wrong? 
A: We missed to review the existing implementation.</h2>
<p>We call it as refactoring.</p>
<p><b>All code is legacy code</b> as soon as it is written. Developers tend to leave dirty code <b>deliberately</b> to avoid blame, to meet dead line, and also to avoid conversation and collaboration. Here are the reasons why developers do that;</p>
<h2>1. To avoid blame</h2>
<p>They know that some code will cause trouble in the future. That’s why company hire them. However, they also know that he/she has to take responsibility of any bugs caused from the improvement they made.</p>
<h2>2. To meet the deadline</h2>
<p>Business want the customer to experience new feature or fixed version as early as possible. However, refactoring takes time. So, what’s the solution? Let it out without any refactoring. When this pattern repeats again and again, you will see the sign,<span class="quote">DO NOT TOUCH ANY OF THESE WIRES!!!</span></p>
<h2>3. To avoid conversations and collaboration</h2>
<p>Some confident developers change the code without letting business or others know, which is not ideal, simply to avoid being controlled , taught or being watched.</p>
<p>Some developers even don’t try any improvement also to avoid being controlled , taught or being watched. It’s just…. hassle.</p>
<h2>To summarize,</h2>
<p>Customers will never ask to review your code implementation. They don’t care you refactor or not. To review your system is your responsibility to serve your customer better. Do NEVER relate this to customer or revenue.</p>
<p>When you have a house, you need to clean up regularly to make your family happy.</p>
<p>When you have code, you need to clean up regularly too to make your customer happy.</p>
